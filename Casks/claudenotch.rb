  app "ClaudeNotch.app"

  # ClaudeNotch is a menu-bar app that stays running. On `brew upgrade`, the old
  # copy must be quit before the new one can replace it, or the install fails
  # with the app "in use" and the update silently does not take effect. `quit`
  # terminates the running instance first so the swap is clean.
  uninstall quit: "com.claudenotch.app"

  # `brew uninstall --zap` also removes the app's own data: persisted state and
  # hook scripts under ~/.claudenotch, debug/crash logs under Application
  # Support, and the preferences plist. (Run ~/.claudenotch/bin/uninstall-hooks.sh
  # first if you also want settings.json restored.)

  caveats <<~EOS
    ClaudeNotch is ad-hoc signed (not yet notarized). On first launch:
      right-click ClaudeNotch in /Applications and choose Open.

    Then open the Setup window from the menu-bar bell to wire up the
    Claude Code hooks.
