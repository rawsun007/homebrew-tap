  # No `verified:`. Homebrew deprecated it and now prints a warning naming this

  # thing anyone installing this way sees. It was never needed: `verified` is
  # for a download host that differs from the homepage, and both of these are
  # github.com/rawsun007/claude-notch, so the default check already passes.

  app "ClaudeNotch.app"

  # ClaudeNotch is a menu-bar app that stays running. On `brew upgrade`, the old
  # copy must be quit before the new one can replace it, or the install fails
  # with the app "in use" and the update silently does not take effect. `quit`
  # terminates the running instance first so the swap is clean.
  uninstall quit: "com.claudenotch.app"

  # `brew uninstall --zap` also removes the app's own data: persisted state and
  # hook scripts under ~/.claudenotch, debug/crash logs under Application
  # Support, and the preferences plist. (Run ~/.claudenotch/bin/uninstall-hooks.sh
  # first if you also want settings.json restored.)

  # No Gatekeeper-bypass step here on purpose. The DMG is signed with a
  # Developer ID and notarized by Apple, with the ticket stapled, so the app
  # launches on a clean machine with no prompt and no network round trip.
  # Telling people to right-click Open when they do not need to teaches them to
  # bypass Gatekeeper for anything calling itself ClaudeNotch.

    Open the Setup window from the menu-bar bell to wire up the
    Claude Code hooks.
